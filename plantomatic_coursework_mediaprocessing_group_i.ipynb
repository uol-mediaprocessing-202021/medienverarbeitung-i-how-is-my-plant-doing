During the introduction weeks several Projects were introduced to pick from. As one of the groupmembers does grow herbs at home the obvious choice here is the project _How Is My Plant Doing_. To briefly explain the goal subject: An image of a plant should be analyzed to tell wether the plant needs watering or not.  \n",
