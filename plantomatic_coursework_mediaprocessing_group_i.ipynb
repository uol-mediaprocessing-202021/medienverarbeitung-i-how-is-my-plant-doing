        "This coursework is part of a multi-project class called _Mediaprocessing_ tought by Prof. Dr. techn. Susanne Boll-Westermann and Dr.-Ing. Larbi Abdenebaoui. During the introduction weeks several Projects were introduced to pick from. As one of the groupmembers does grow herbs at home the obvious choice here is the project _How Is My Plant Doing_. To briefly explain the goal subject: An image of a plant should be analyzed to tell wether the plant needs watering or not.  \n",

        "The idea outlines that some sort of robot will take care of a kitchen-garden. The robot should move from plant to plant taking pictures and processing the images. Afterwards the images will be analyzed and classified. The robot decides wether the plant needs to be watered or not. In the letter case a message will be send to the owners mobile device to inform about the plants state. The message could contain the image of the plant itself as well. As there is no access to a real robot which actually is able to move. This project will make use of a stationary Raspberry-Pi computer with a camera attached to it.   \n",
