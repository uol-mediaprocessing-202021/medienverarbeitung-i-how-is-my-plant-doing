        "This coursework is part of a multi-project class called _Mediaprocessing_ taught by Prof. Dr. techn. Susanne Boll-Westermann and Dr.-Ing. Larbi Abdenebaoui. During the introduction weeks several Projects were introduced to pick from. As one of the group members does grow herbs at home the obvious choice here is the project _How Is My Plant Doing_. To briefly explain the goal subject: An image of a plant should be analyzed to tell whether the plant needs watering or not.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.2. Case/Goal\n",

        "The main goal of the project is to distinguish between two different plants and classify them to get an idea about their current state. \n",

        "The idea outlines that some sort of robot will take care of a kitchen-garden. The robot should move from plant to plant taking pictures and processing the images. Afterwards the images will be analyzed and classified. The robot decides whether the plant needs to be watered or not. In the letter case a message will be send to the owner’s mobile device to inform about the plants state. The message could contain the image of the plant itself as well. As there is no access to a real robot which actually is able to move. This project will make use of a stationary Raspberry Pi computer with a camera attached to it. The Raspberry Pi will then take a set of pictures every hour and evaluate the plant-state directly.    \n",
